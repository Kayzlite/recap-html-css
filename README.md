# Pair Project
## This is our website project, presented by Mahmoud Abdo and Kevin Lagey

*We edited the original website of Becode, to make it more user-friendly, and given it an English translation*

## Time spent in it:

*The whole project took us 4 days to finish. We completed the HTML structure almost the first day, we did had some trouble to achieve our CSS, especially on positionning the Google Map hover effect, but we managed to fix it and all went perfectly well after that.*

## Background experience:

*I'm a beginner in the front-end web developpement but my fellow Mahmoud had some strong basics, he dealt with most of the problemes, keeping me updated of any changes or problems he encountered. Together, we managed to come to a final result and we're proud of it*
